# TestdataCreator

Very simple Scala project to illustrate the use of [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/) to generate testdata with potential interdependencies between fields.


## Pre-Requisites

Installed [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)

[IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is capable to import SBT projects, provided the free Scala plugin is active.
